# How to use tutorial

Red squiggles will appear in the editor if the code
does not compile or if your code has identified invalid data. The
invalid data will also be highlighted in table.

Both the code and the data can be edited. If you make changes
to the code, remember to click "Run" to recompile your changes.

Go ahead and edit Joe's age in the table so that it is not
negative.
