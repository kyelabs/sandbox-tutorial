Kye is a programming language for validating data.
It can execute arbitrary assertion expressions, across
many different sources of data.

and document your data models.

## How to use this tutorial

After you make some changes to the code click "Run" to recompile
and validate the data in the table. The values within the
table can edited as well.

Red squiggles will appear in the editor if the code
does not compile or if the data is invalid. The
invalid data will be highlighted in table as well.

Go ahead and edit Joe's age in the table so that it is not
negative.
